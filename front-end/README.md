## Introduction

A magic 8ball â€” for love! Sign up and send your partner a link where they can share their ideas on love. Then you can ask your 8heart for personalized love advice. When you speak to it, it transcribes the speech and sends it to the OpenAI API, and then generates a response with the help of some clever prompt engineering. Full stack app developed using the MERN stack.

This is an extremely over-engineerred soluton to a simple problem, but it was a fun project to work on. I learned a lot about the MERN stack, and I got to play around with some cool technologies like JWT tokens and the OpenAI API. All the logic for browser cookies, data validation, database schemas and API calls is written from scratch. This could've been simplified by using services like Firebase, or by using the OpenAI library for Node.js, but I opted out just for the learnign experience.

Technologies used: React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, OpenAI API, JWT, Axios, Material-UI, React Router, React Speech Recognition, React Cookie, Mongoose, Axios, and more.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
